However, depending on the reason for travel, who travels, and other circumstances, other computation rules may apply and impact the amount that a traveler is reimbursed.  The AO must verify that the traveler does not meet the conditions addressed elsewhere in Chapter 3.</div></li></ol></div></div></section></chapter></main></article>
