                <content>A traveler on routine TDY ordinarily receives the transportation and per diem allowances in Chapter 2.  However, depending on the reason for travel, who travels, and other circumstances, other computation rules may apply and impact the amount that a traveler is reimbursed.  The AO must verify that the traveler does not meet the conditions addressed elsewhere in Chapter 3.</content>
